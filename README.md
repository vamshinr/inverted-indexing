# inverted-indexing
This repo provides how inverted indexing, a index data structure,  works from scratch with implementation in python. Inverted indexing is most fastest way for full text searches with the help of tf-idf kind of approach. This technique is used in document retrieval systems, search engines and in elastic search too.
(used fake in-memory db for implementation purpose)
